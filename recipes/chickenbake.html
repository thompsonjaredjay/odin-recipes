  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Costco's Chicken Bakes have a special place in my heart. I used to eat one every day for lunch from middle school to halfway through college. They were so convenient to pop in the microwave, wait two minutes, and <em>BAM!</em> flavor town. They are wonderful sandwich rolls covered with italian cheeses and stuffed with chicken, bacon and creamy Caesar dressing.</p>
    <p>This recipe is a copycat of Kirkland's microwaveable masterpiece. Why go through all the work when you can just microwave it? I have no clue. But, you might get a sense of pride from making it yourself and you get to taste what it's like when the ingredients are not frozen.</p>
    <p>This recipe takes 15 minutes of prep time and 45 minutes of cook time for a total of 1 hour. It yields 3 chicken bakes which can serve 6 people.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 pound prepared pizza dough</li>
    <li>3 skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>3/4 cup water, or more as needed</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, or as needed for surface</li>
    <li>1/2 cup creamy Caesar dressing</li>
    <li>6 slices of bacon, cooked and crumbled</li>
    <li>1 cup shredded Italian cheeses, such as mozzarella and provolone, divided</li>
    <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Let pizza dough rest at room temperature for about 1 hour before using</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)</li>
    <li>Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil, and lay bacon strips in a single layer on the sheet</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned and crisp, about 15 minutes</li> 
    <li>Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Crumble when cool enough to handle. Leave the oven on</li>
    <li>Season chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic powder</li> 
    <li>Heat a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat</li>
    <li>Add oil and place chicken breast in the skillet, seasoned side down</li>
    <li>Cook undisturbed until golden brown, about 5 minutes</li>
    <li>Season the top side, flip, and cook 1 more minute</li>
    <li>Add just enough water to fill the bottom of the pan and remove pan from heat</li>
    <li>Bake chicken in the preheated oven until an instant read thermometer, inserted near the center, reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 17 to 20 minutes</li>
    <li>Remove from heat and let stand until cool enough to handle, then chop chicken and set aside</li>
    <li>Increase oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C), line a baking sheet with parchment</li>
    <li>Sprinkle flour onto a large work surface and divide pizza dough into 3 circular portions with 12 to 13 inch diameter</li>
    <li>Spread dressing evenly over dough circles, leaving a 1-inch border</li>
    <li>Sprinkle 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese over dressing, reserve 2 tablespoons shredded italian cheese blend and set aside</li>
    <li>Top dough circles evenly with chicken, bacon, green onion, and remaining italian cheese blend</li>
    <li>Fold outer left and right sides slightly over the filling, roll the bottom of the dough circle over the filling and then roll towards the top edge until fully wrapped</li>
    <li> Pinch edges to seal and use hands to work into a long log shape about 12 inches long</li>
    <li>Place filled dough, seam side down, on the prepared baking sheet</li>
    <li>Brush beaten egg over tops of dough and sprinkle evenly with cheese blend and sprinkle each with 1 tablespoon shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes</li>
  </ol>
