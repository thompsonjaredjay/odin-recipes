  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Costco's Chicken Bakes have a special place in my heart. I used to eat one every day for lunch from middle school to halfway through college. They were so convenient to pop in the microwave, wait two minutes, and BAM! flavor town. They are wonderful sandwich rolls covered with italian cheeses and stuffed with chicken, bacon and creamy Caesar dressing.</p>
    <p>This recipe is a copycat of Kirkland's microwaveable masterpiece. Why go through all the work when you can just microwave it? I have no clue. But, you might get a sense of pride from making it yourself and you get to taste what it's like when the ingredients are not frozen.</p>
    <p>This recipe takes 15 minutes of prep time and 45 minutes of cook time for a total of 1 hour. It yields 3 chicken bakes which can serve 6 people.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 pound prepared pizza dough</li>
    <li>3 skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil</li>

    <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, or as needed for surface</li>
    <li>1/2 cup creamy Caesar dressing</li>
    <li>6 slices of bacon, cooked and crumbled</li>

  </ul>
