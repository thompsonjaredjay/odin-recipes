        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is one of my two favorite tostada recipes ever. This one has a special place in my heart because it reminds me of the first time my wife and I visited a farmers market together in Utah. There was a mexican food truck and we tried a bunch of different dishes but we fell in love with the tinga tostadas instantly.</p>
        <p>This recipe has a prep time of 20 minutes and a cook time of 1 hour for a total of 1 hour and 20 minutes. It yields 8 servings</p>
