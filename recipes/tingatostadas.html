        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is one of my two favorite tostada recipes ever. This one has a special place in my heart because it reminds me of the first time my wife and I visited a farmers market together in Utah. There was a mexican food truck and we tried a bunch of different dishes but we fell in love with the tinga tostadas instantly.</p>
        <p>This recipe has a prep time of 20 minutes and a cook time of 1 hour for a total of 1 hour and 20 minutes. It yields 8 servings</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 bone-in chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>7 medium onions, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>6 medium tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 (7 ounce) can chipotle peppers in adobo sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chicken bouillon granules</li>
            <li>16 tostada shells</li>
            <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the chicken into a large pot along with 1/4 cup of sliced onion, garlic, and enough water to cover</li> 
            <li>Bring to a boil, and cook until no longer pink, about 25 minutes</li>
            <li>Remove chicken, cool, and shred meat. Discard skin and bones</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the remaining onion slices, and fry until transparent</li> 
            <li>Place tomatoes into a pan of boiling water (you could use the leftover chicken water), and boil until they split open</li>
            <li>Place the tomatoes, the whole can of chipotle peppers, chicken bouillon into a blender or large food processor. Process until smooth</li>
            <li>Season with salt and pepper</li> 
            <li>Pour this mixture into a large pan, and add the shredded chicken and cooked onions. Heat through</li>
            <li>To serve, each person spreads some sour cream on their tostada shell, and tops with a spoonful of the chicken (my wife and I like to substitute the sour cream with mayonnaise)</li>   
        </ol>
