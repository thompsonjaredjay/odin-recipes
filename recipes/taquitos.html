 <h2>Description</h2>
 <p>Along with chicken bakes I would also eat El Monterey chicken taquitos from Costco. I know, I am surprised I did not get fat. This recipe is not a copycat but they are fast, and easy to make. You can serve with sour cream, Mexican tomato sauce, and guacamole.</p>
 <p>This recipe has a 10 minute prep time and a 20 minute cook time for a total time of 30 minutes. It yields 6 taquitos with a serving size of 1 taquito.</p>

 <h2>Ingredients</h2>
 <ul>
    <li> 1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons diced onion</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons chopped green chiles</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons Mexican-style got tomato sauce</li>
    <li>1 cup shredded rotisserie chicken</li>
    <li>1/2 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons Neufchâtel cheese</li>
    <li>salt and ground black pepper</li>
    <li>6 corn tortillas</li>
    <li>avocado oil cooking spray</li>

    <li>Season with salt and pepper</li>
    <li>Heat tortillas in a skillet or directly on the grates of a gas stove until soft and pliable</li>
    <li>Place 3 tablespoons of chicken mixture down the center of each tortilla. Fold over and roll into taquitos</li>
    <li>Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)</li>
    <li>Place taquitos in a single layer in the air fryer basket, making sure they are not touching, and mist with avocado oil</li>

    <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
